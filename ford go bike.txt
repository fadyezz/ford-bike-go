data is ford go bike:

Data wrangling process:
fix multiple fields that are not in the correct dtype, 
- start_time, end_time should be datetime type, user_type and member_gender 
  should be categorical data type

make new columns for trip duration in minute, trip start date in yyyy-mm-dd format
make new columns trip start hour of the day, day of week and month
make new column calculating riders' age from 'member_birth_year'
filter out outlier ages from visual examination of the member age distribution and statistical percentile
cast 'member_birth_year' and 'member_age' to integer instead of float type
cast 'start_dayofweek' to category dtype
cast 'start_month' to category dtype for easy plotting
filter out outlier trip records where the duration was longer than normal 


Findings in our data 

The number of trips peaked around 8-9am and 17-18pm during a day, there were more trips on work days (Mon-Fri) compared to weekends, the trip duration is longer in weekends vs working days
